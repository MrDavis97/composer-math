# MD Composer Extras

This Discourse theme component adds a formatting button option that puts dollar sign delimiters around highlighted text to your Discourse composer, in order to render MathJax.

This addition is responsive for desktops and phones, but not for horizon orientation or tablets. This addition has taken into consideration [Slick](https://github.com/discourse/Discourse-Slick-image-gallery), [Tiles](https://github.com/discourse/Discourse-Tiles-image-gallery), and [Events](https://github.com/angusmcleod/discourse-events) when determining what should be placed on the composer bar.

There is currently no implemented option for disabling this button, but this can be done through CSS.
